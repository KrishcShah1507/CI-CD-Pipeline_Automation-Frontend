🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Automation for Frontend Deployment – PepsiCo Virtual Experience
📌 Overview
As part of the PepsiCo Job Simulation on Forage, I designed and implemented a complete CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline for a frontend web application. The goal was to streamline the deployment process and ensure high-quality, scalable delivery to cloud infrastructure using Azure.

🔧 What I Did
✅ Version Control: Connected the frontend GitHub repository for seamless version control using Git, enabling collaborative development and consistent code history.

🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Creation: Configured a CI/CD workflow to automate the build, test, and deployment stages for the frontend application.

☁️ Deployment to Azure: Integrated the pipeline with Microsoft Azure to automatically deploy updates to the live environment on every push to the main branch.

🔄 Continuous Integration: Ensured code quality and performance by incorporating automated testing and pre-deployment checks.

🧰 DevOps Best Practices: Followed DevOps principles to build a reliable and scalable deployment architecture with minimal manual intervention.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Version Control: Git, GitHub

CI/CD Tools: GitHub Actions (or other CI/CD tools as applicable)

Cloud Platform: Microsoft Azure

Frontend Framework: React.js / HTML/CSS/JavaScript (mention whatever you used)

Testing (Optional): Jest, React Testing Library (if used)
